                      Hi @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }},

                      It looks like this pull-request is has been made against the ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}} `master` or `main` branch.
                      The `master`/`main` branch should always contain code from the latest release.
                      Because of this, PRs to `master`/`main` are only allowed if they come from any ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}} `release` or `patch` branch.

                      You do not need to close this PR, you can change the target branch to `development` by clicking the _"Edit"_ button at the top of this page.

                      Thanks again for your contribution!

                      It looks like this pull-request is has been made against the ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}} `master`/`main` branch.
                      A version check determined that you are using a SNAPSHOT version.
                      The `master`/`main` branch should never have any SNAPSHOT versions, since only fully stable code should be on the `master`/`main` branch.
