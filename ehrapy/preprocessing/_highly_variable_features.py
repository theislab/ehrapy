    """Annotate highly variable features.

    Expects count data. A normalized variance for each feature is computed. First, the data
    are standardized (i.e., z-score normalization per feature) with a regularized
    standard deviation. Next, the normalized variance is computed as the variance
    of each feature after the transformation. Features are ranked by the normalized variance.

    Args:
        adata: The annotated data matrix of shape `n_obs` Ã— `n_vars`.
        layer: If provided, use `adata.layers[layer]` for expression values instead of `adata.X`.
        top_features_percentage: Percentage of highly-variable features to keep.
        span: The fraction of the data used when estimating the variance in the loess model fit.
        n_bins: Number of bins for binning. Normalization is done with respect to each bin.
                If just a single observation falls into a bin, the normalized dispersion is artificially set to 1.
                You'll be informed about this if you set `settings.verbosity = 4`.
        subset: Inplace subset to highly-variable features if `True` otherwise merely indicate highly variable features.
        inplace: Whether to place calculated metrics in `.var` or return them.
        check_values: Check if counts in selected layer are integers. A Warning is returned if set to True.

    Returns:
        Depending on `inplace` returns calculated metrics (:class:`~pandas.DataFrame`) or
        updates `.var` with the following fields

    **highly_variable**
        boolean indicator of highly-variable features
    **means**
        means per feature
    **variances**
        variance per feature
    **variances_norm**
        normalized variance per feature, averaged in the case of multiple batches
    **highly_variable_rank**
        rank of the feature according to normalized variance, median rank in the case of multiple batches
