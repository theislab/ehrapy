    """Calculates t-SNE [Maaten08]_ [Amir13]_ [Pedregosa11]_.

    t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (tSNE) [Maaten08]_ has been
    proposed for visualizing complex by [Amir13]_. Here, by default, we use the implementation of *scikit-learn* [Pedregosa11]_.

    Args:
        adata: :class:`~anndata.AnnData` object containing all observations.
        n_pcs: Use this many PCs. If `n_pcs==0` use `.X` if `use_rep is None`.
        use_rep: Use the indicated representation. `'X'` or any key for `.obsm` is valid.
                 If `None`, the representation is chosen automatically:
                 For `.n_vars` < 50, `.X` is used, otherwise 'X_pca' is used.
                 If 'X_pca' is not present, itâ€™s computed with default parameters.
        perplexity: The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors that
                    is used in other manifold learning algorithms. Larger datasets usually require a larger perplexity.
                    Consider selecting a value between 5 and 50. The choice is not extremely critical since t-SNE
                    is quite insensitive to this parameter.
        early_exaggeration: Controls how tight natural clusters in the original space are in the
                            embedded space and how much space will be between them. For larger
                            values, the space between natural clusters will be larger in the
                            embedded space. Again, the choice of this parameter is not very
                            critical. If the cost function increases during initial optimization,
                            the early exaggeration factor or the learning rate might be too high.
        learning_rate: Note that the R-package "Rtsne" uses a default of 200.
                       The learning rate can be a critical parameter. It should be
                       between 100 and 1000. If the cost function increases during initial
                       optimization, the early exaggeration factor or the learning rate
                       might be too high. If the cost function gets stuck in a bad local
                       minimum increasing the learning rate helps sometimes.
        random_state: Change this to use different intial states for the optimization.
                      If `None`, the initial state is not reproducible.
        n_jobs: Number of jobs for parallel computation.
                `None` means using :attr:`scanpy._settings.ScanpyConfig.n_jobs`.
        copy: Return a copy instead of writing to `adata`.
        metric: Distance metric to calculate neighbors on.

    Returns:
        Depending on `copy`, returns or updates `adata` with the following fields.

    """Embed the neighborhood graph using UMAP [McInnes18]_.

    UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a manifold learning
    technique suitable for visualizing high-dimensional data. Besides tending to
    be faster than tSNE, it optimizes the embedding such that it best reflects
    the topology of the data, which we represent throughout ehrapy using a
    neighborhood graph. tSNE, by contrast, optimizes the distribution of
    nearest-neighbor distances in the embedding such that these best match the
    distribution of distances in the high-dimensional space. We use the
    implementation of `umap-learn <https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap>`__
    [McInnes18]_. For a few comparisons of UMAP with tSNE, see this `preprint
    <https://doi.org/10.1101/298430>`__.

    Args:
        adata: :class:`~anndata.AnnData` object containing all observations.
        min_dist: The effective minimum distance between embedded points. Smaller values
                  will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby points on
                  the manifold are drawn closer together, while larger values will result
                  on a more even dispersal of points. The value should be set relative to
                  the ``spread`` value, which determines the scale at which embedded
                  points will be spread out. The default of in the `umap-learn` package is 0.1.
        spread: The effective scale of embedded points.
                In combination with `min_dist` this determines how clustered/clumped the embedded points are.
        n_components: The number of dimensions of the embedding.
        maxiter: The number of iterations (epochs) of the optimization. Called `n_epochs` in the original UMAP.
        alpha: The initial learning rate for the embedding optimization.
        gamma: Weighting applied to negative samples in low dimensional embedding optimization.
               Values higher than one will result in greater weight being given to negative samples.
        negative_sample_rate: The number of negative edge/1-simplex samples to use per positive
                              edge/1-simplex sample in optimizing the low dimensional embedding.
        init_pos: How to initialize the low dimensional embedding. Called `init` in the original UMAP. Options are:

                  * Any key for `adata.obsm`.

                  * 'paga': positions from :func:`~scanpy.pl.paga`.

                  * 'random': assign initial embedding positions at random.

                  * A numpy array of initial embedding positions.
        random_state: Random state for the initialization.

                      * If `int`, `random_state` is the seed used by the random number generator;

                      * If `RandomState` or `Generator`, `random_state` is the random number generator;

                      * If `None`, the random number generator is the `RandomState` instance used by `np.random`.
        a: More specific parameters controlling the embedding.

        b: More specific parameters controlling the embedding.

    By default, the PCA representation is used unless `.X` has less than 50 variables.
    Alternatively, a list of `var_names` (e.g. genes) can be given.
    Average values of either `var_names` or components are used to compute a correlation matrix.

    The hierarchical clustering can be visualized using
    :func:`ehrapy.pl.dendrogram` or multiple other visualizations that can
    include a dendrogram: :func:`~ehrapy.pl.matrixplot`,
    :func:`~ehrapy.pl.heatmap`, :func:`~ehrapy.pl.dotplot`,
    and :func:`~ehrapy.pl.stacked_violin`.

    .. note::
        The computation of the hierarchical clustering is based on predefined
        groups and not per observation. The correlation matrix is computed using by
        default pearson but other methods are available.

    Args:
        adata: :class:`~anndata.AnnData` object containing all observations.

        n_pcs: Use this many PCs. If `n_pcs==0` use `.X` if `use_rep is None`.
        use_rep: Use the indicated representation. `'X'` or any key for `.obsm` is valid.
                 If `None`, the representation is chosen automatically:
                 For `.n_vars` < 50, `.X` is used, otherwise 'X_pca' is used.
                 If 'X_pca' is not present, itâ€™s computed with default parameters.
        var_names: List of var_names to use for computing the hierarchical clustering.
                   If `var_names` is given, then `use_rep` and `n_pcs` is ignored.
        cor_method: correlation method to use.
                    Options are 'pearson', 'kendall', and 'spearman'
        linkage_method: linkage method to use. See :func:`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` for more information.
        optimal_ordering: Same as the optimal_ordering argument of :func:`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`
                          which reorders the linkage matrix so that the distance between successive leaves is minimal.
        key_added: By default, the dendrogram information is added to
                   `.uns[f'dendrogram_{{groupby}}']`.
                   Notice that the `groupby` information is added to the dendrogram.

    Reconstruct the progression of a biological process from snapshot
    data. `Diffusion Pseudotime` has been introduced by [Haghverdi16]_ and

    version, which is able to deal with disconnected graphs [Wolf19]_ and can
    be run in a `hierarchical` mode by setting the parameter `n_branchings>1`.
    We recommend, however, to only use :func:`~ehrapy.tl.dpt` for computing pseudotime (`n_branchings=0`) and
    to detect branchings via :func:`~scanpy.tl.paga`. For pseudotime, you need
    to annotate your data with a root cell. For instance `adata.uns['iroot'] = np.flatnonzero(adata.obs['cell_types'] == 'Stem')[0]`
    This requires to run :func:`~ehrapy.pp.neighbors`, first. In order to
    reproduce the original implementation of DPT, use `method=='gauss'` in
    this. Using the default `method=='umap'` only leads to minor quantitative differences, though.

                        points. If a float, `min_group_size` refers to a fraction of the total number of data points.
        allow_kendall_tau_shift: If a very small branch is detected upon splitting, shift away from
                                 maximum correlation in Kendall tau criterion of [Haghverdi16]_ to stabilize the splitting.

    By quantifying the connectivity of partitions (groups, clusters),
    partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) generates a much
    simpler abstracted graph (*PAGA graph*) of partitions, in which edge weights
    represent confidence in the presence of connections. By tresholding this
    confidence in :func:`~ehrapy.pl.paga`, a much simpler representation of the
    manifold data is obtained, which is nonetheless faithful to the topology of
    the manifold.
    The confidence should be interpreted as the ratio of the actual versus the
    expected value of connections under the null model of randomly connecting
    partitions. We do not provide a p-value as this null model does not
    precisely capture what one would consider "connected" in real data, hence it
    strongly overestimates the expected value. See an extensive discussion of this in [Wolf19]_.
