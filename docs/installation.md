# Installation

## Stable release

To install ehrapy, run this command in your terminal:

```console
pip install ehrapy
```

This is the preferred method to install ehrapy, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip] installed, this [Python installation guide] can guide you through the process.

If you run into "RuntimeError: CMake must be installed to build qdldl" ensure that you have CMake installed to build lightgbm.
Run `conda install -c anaconda cmake` and `conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm` to do so.

If you intend to run MedCAT you have to install a language model like:

```console
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## From sources

The sources for ehrapy can be downloaded from the [Github repo].

You can either clone the public repository:

```console
git clone git://github.com/theislab/ehrapy
```

Or download the [tarball]:

```console
curl -OJL https://github.com/theislab/ehrapy/tarball/master
```

## MedCAT/Spacy language models

If you want to run and use medcat with ehrapy, you first have to install the medcat extra:

```console
pip install ehrapy[medcat]
```

Available language models are

-   en_core_web_md (python -m spacy download en_core_web_md)
